Explanation/Notes: The key divergence occurs when the user interacts with the application. In the traditional approach, a new page is requested from the server, resulting in a full page reload (URL redirect). Conversely, in the SPA, user interactions, such as entering a new note, are handled asynchronously by the client-side JavaScript. This means that after the initial load, the user can perform actions without reloading the entire page, leading to a more dynamic and seamless user experience.
